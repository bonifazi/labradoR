The goal of `labradoR` R package is to facilitating the handling and post-processing of the [`Retriever`](https://genebankdata.cgn.wur.nl/software/software.html) software output. Retriever is a software for pedigree analysis that generates many statistics and plots. For more information please refer to the [official software website](https://genebankdata.cgn.wur.nl/software/software.html) and it associated [publication](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/5/1332).

`labradoR` help users to import the output generated by Retriever into R for further manipulation and downstream analyses. `labradoR` loads the main tabular information into data frames and generates associated plots using `ggplot2` objects trying to emulate those of Retriever.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `labradoR` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bonifazi/labradoR")
```

## Example usage

The below is a basic example showing the package usage. As input, you need to provide the path to the `.out` file generated by Retriever. Note that the `.out` file can be in English or in Dutch (depending on the settings used when running Retriever). Both languages are supported: set the needed language using the `language` argument (ENG for English and DUT for Dutch).

    library(labradoR)
    ## example usage
    output <- process_retriever(file_name = "C:/myPath/pedigree_Retriever.out",
     language = "ENG")

    str(output, max.levels = 1, give.attr = F)

Note: since the logic of `labradoR` is that of "fetching" lines from Retriever's output, if anything changes in the format of the `.out` file, then `labradoR`'s associated code will need to be adapted accordingly.
