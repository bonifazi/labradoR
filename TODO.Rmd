# TODO:

-   [done in Version: 0.0.0.9002] improve error on main functions (extract\_ etc...) now when phrase is not found it returs phrase not found but could return *which* phrases are being searched and being missing. Now returns the name of what has been searching, maybe we can have a closer-match way returned to user with some Rpackage?
-   improve README with more information and show what the pkg can do
-   take a pedigree as example for doc and (optionally) testing purposes
-   now there are several dependencies instead they should be import and code should be writing pkg::funct()
-   remove the 'year' constrain and just use the first column (to make more flexible?)
-   remove the limits on y-axis and the 5-years groups for x-axis (could be default and then user-defined if wanted)
