\usage{
extract_text(content_lines, keyword)
}
\arguments{
\item{content_lines}{A character vector representing the lines of a file.}

\item{keyword}{A character string indicating the keyword to locate in the file.}
}
\value{
A character vector containing the extracted text between the underscore delimiters.
}
\description{
This function extracts text from a vector of content lines, starting from a specified keyword
and returning the text between lines that contain at least five consecutive underscores.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item The function searches for the first occurrence of the given keyword in the content lines.
\item After locating the keyword, it identifies the first and last lines that contain at least five
consecutive underscores, treating them as delimiters.
\item The function then returns the text between these two delimiters.
\item If the keyword is not found, the function will calculate the Jaccard similarity to find the closest match in the text and will return a warning message with the closest match information.
\item If the keyword is found in multiple places, only the first match will be used, and a warning will be issued.
}

\examples{
content <- c("Some text", "Keyword", "______", "Extract this text", "______", "More text")
