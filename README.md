The goal of the `labradoR` R package is to facilitate the handling and
post-processing in R of the output from
[`Retriever`](https://genebankdata.cgn.wur.nl/software/software.html)
software.

`Retriever` is a software for retrieving information on population
structure, inbreeding, and kinship from pedigrees analysis generating
many statistics and plots. For more information on `Retriever` please
refer to the
<a href="#0" style="font-size: 11pt;">official software website</a> and
it associated <a href="#0" style="font-size: 11pt;">publication</a>.

`labradoR` help users to import the output generated by `Retriever` into
R for further manipulation and downstream analyses. `labradoR` loads the
main tabular information into `data.frames` and generates associated
`ggplot2` plots objects similar to those of `Retriever`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `labradoR` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bonifazi/labradoR")
```

## Usage

The below is a basic example showing the package usage. As input, you
need to provide the path to the `.out` file generated by `Retriever`.
Note that the `.out` file can be in English or in Dutch (depending on
the settings used when running `Retriever`). Both languages are
supported: set the needed language using the `language` argument (ENG
for English and DUT for Dutch).

    library(labradoR)
    ## example usage
    output <- process_retriever(file_name = "C:/myPath/pedigree_Retriever.out",
     language = "ENG")

    str(output, max.levels = 1, give.attr = F)

Note: since the logic of `labradoR` is that of “fetching” lines from
`Retriever`’s output, if anything changes in the format of the `.out`
file, then `labradoR`’s associated code will need to be adapted
accordingly.

## Example output

You can find an example of the output generated by `labradoR`
[here](doc/Create_report_sheep_example.md).  
Note that this report is just to show the main outputs of the package.
Here `Retriever` was run on a sheep pedigree simulated using `MoBPS`
(code [here](dev/Simulate_sheep_test_dataset.R) ). Real pedigrees will
likely show much more uneven distributions.
